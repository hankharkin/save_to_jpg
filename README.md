# save_to_jpg
Quick Photoshop script to flatten layers and save the image as a jpg in the same folder

This is a simple script for Photoshop that I made because file explorers don't want to let you preview PSD files.
Now, you can open up your psd files in Photoshop, run this script, and you will have a jpg of the same name that you can preview in file explorer.

It closes the psd file without saving any changes to it and there are no dialogs or warnings for file overwriting.
